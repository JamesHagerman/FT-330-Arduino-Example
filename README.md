FT-330-Arduino-Example
======================

This is a simple Arduino example for the FT-330 Series Turbine Flow Sensor. These sensors are sold by KegBot

These sensors just pulse the white wire as fluid is flowing through it. Basically, 10,000 puleses per gallon.

Beware the flow direction

Beware the pinout
